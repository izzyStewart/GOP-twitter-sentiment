# GOP debate - twitter sentiment analysis
<br>
<p>In this project I am using the chosen dataset to build a neural network and investigate different hyper-parameter settings to optimize its performance. I wanted to explore my interest in natural language processing and how successful a neural network can be predicting the sentiment of a text based dataset. With this in mind I found an interesting dataset from Kaggle that took tweets that used the hashtag from the Republican GOP debate in 2016. Contributors to the dataset were asked if each tweet had a positive, negative or neutral tone and the result was then stored in the variable 'sentiment.' I thought using tweets from a debate like this would be an interesting experiment for a neural network where many people have very strong opinions, which would come through in the words contained in the tweet data.</p>
